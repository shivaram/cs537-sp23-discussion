How to add user-level application?
   - Add your application under user/. Eg: user/hello.c
   - Make changes to user/makefile.mk to include your binary name
   - Compile 
   - Run the application inside xv6 to make sure its working
System call tracing for getpid()
   -User code
	- user/user.h a list of system calls availabel in xv6
        - include/sys
   -Kernel code
	- mainc() in main initializes the trap table by calling tvinit
        - trap.c initializes the traphandler for system call
        - vectors(in kernel/vectors.S) make a call to alltraps
        - alltraps is in trapasm.S
        - alltraps sets up the trapframe(in include/x86.h) and jumpas to trap(in kernel/trap.c)
        - trap() in turn calls syscall() in kernel/sysproc.c
